ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is stephematician. I'm a mathematician, programmer, and former
researcher in tobacco control and public health.

My projects are primarily hosted on gitlab.com
<https://gitlab.com/stephematician>.

Highlights include:

-   [linuxgreenscreen](https://gitlab.com/stephematician/linuxgreenscreen) - a
    virtual "green screen" effect for GNU/Linux; see the announcement
    [here](https://stephematician.gitlab.io/posts/2023/announcing_linuxgreenscreen/).
-   [r-gitlab-ci](https://gitlab.com/stephematician/r-gitlab-ci) a partial port
    of [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) for GitLab CI/CD for
    R package development.

See you there!
